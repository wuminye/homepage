abstract: A surface light field represents the radiance of rays originating from
  any points on the surface in any directions. Traditional approaches require
  ultra-dense sampling to ensure the rendering quality. In this paper, we
  present a novel neural network based technique called deep surface light field
  or DSLF to use only moderate sampling for high fidelity rendering. DSLF
  automatically fills in the missing data by leveraging different sampling
  patterns across the vertices and at the same time eliminates redundancies due
  to the network's prediction capability. For real data, we address the image
  registration problem as well as conduct texture-aware remeshing for aligning
  texture edges with vertices to avoid blurring. Comprehensive experiments show
  that DSLF can further achieve high data compression ratio while facilitating
  real-time rendering on the GPU.
