abstract: We present an end-to-end Neural Human Renderer (NHR) for dynamic human
  captures under the multi-view setting. NHR adopts PointNet++ for feature
  extraction (FE) to enable robust 3D correspondence matching on low quality,
  dynamic 3D reconstructions. To render new views, we map 3D features onto the
  target camera as a 2D feature map and employ an anti-aliased CNN to handle
  holes and noises. Newly synthesized views from NHR can be further used to
  construct visual hulls to handle textureless and/or dark regions such as black
  clothing. Comprehensive experiments show NHR significantly outperforms the
  state-of-the-art neural and image-based rendering techniques, especially on
  hands, hair, nose, foot, etc.
