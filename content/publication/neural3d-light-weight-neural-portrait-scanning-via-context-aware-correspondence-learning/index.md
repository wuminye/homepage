abstract: "Reconstructing a human portrait in a realistic and convenient manner
  is critical for human modeling and understanding. Aiming at light-weight and
  realistic human portrait reconstruction, in this paper we propose Neural3D: a
  novel neural human portrait scanning system using only a single RGB camera. In
  our system, to enable accurate pose estimation,we propose a context-aware
  correspondence learning approach which jointly models the appearance, spatial
  and motion information between feature pairs. To enable realistic
  reconstruction and suppress the geometry error, we further adopt a point-based
  neural rendering scheme to generate realistic and immersive portrait
  visualization in arbitrary virtual view-points. By introducing these
  learning-based technical components into the pure RGB-based human modeling
  framework, we can achieve both accurate camera pose estimation and realistic
  free-viewpoint rendering of the reconstructed human portrait. Extensive
  experiments on a variety of challenging capture scenarios demonstrate the
  robustness and effectiveness of our approach."
